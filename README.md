# Cost-Optimal Sizing of Residential Grid-Tied PV and Battery System

This repository contains the LaTeX source (`.tex`) and PDF (`.pdf`) files of the research paper titled "Cost-Optimal Sizing of Residential Grid-Tied PV and Battery System".

## Abstract

This paper explores the integration of residential grid-tied PV (Photovoltaic) and battery storage systems to better understand the sizing of grid-tied PV and BESS (Battery Energy Storage System). For this purpose, a simulation model is built based on the Photovoltaic Geographical Information System to determine PV power forecasts and samples of energy consumption of a normal household in Austria for a period of one year in 15-minute intervals. The current cost of energy from the grid and the current cost of the feed-in tariff in â‚¬/kWh are considered. Various PV sizes and battery sizes are considered for this simulation. The effect of varying different PV sizes and battery sizes is analyzed to determine the cost-optimal system configuration. Self-sufficiency (Autarky) and self-consumption are averaged to determine the cost-optimal PV and BESS configuration for a residential home.
